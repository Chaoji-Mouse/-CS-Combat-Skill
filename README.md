This is a minecraft mod for forge

It's made by Mcreator

Don't you think the original combat is too monotonous?
Maybe you just want a combat mod that's more geared towards the original.
"Combat Skill"introduces a new trick to the original way of fighting - parrying
You can parry by pressing the R key
When parrying, you can block most damage and stun the target who attacks you
Of course, if you don't get the timing right, you'll go into a vertigo state.
Add this mod and enjoy the battle!
